My takewaways and/or quotes from the book <em>Accelerate - The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</em> by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim are given below.

- High IT performance correlates with strong business performance.
- People are an organization's #1 asset.
- Queue theory in maths tells us that as utilization approaches 100%, lead times approach infinity.
- Useful measures of software delivery performance:
    1. Delivery lead time: The time it takes to deliver a feature to customers.
    2. Deployment frequency (as a proxy for batch size).
    3. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR).
    4. Change fail percentage.
- The ability to take an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery.
- Use a Wardley map to find opportunity, remove waste, help to organise a team of people or determine the strategy for a company (<a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec</a>).
- Westrum's classification of organizational cultures:
    - Pathological (power-oriented): Organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons or distort it to make themselves look better.
    - Bureaucratic (rule-oriented): Organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their "turf", insist on their own rules, and generally do this by the book - their book.
    - Generative (performance-oriented): Organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do.
- According to Westrum organizational culture predicts the way information flows through an organisation.
- Table 3.1 comparing organizational cultures looks useful; see p32 for details.
- Figure 3.1 provides an example of the type of questions that can be used to measure culture.
- According to Westrum's theory organizations with better information flow function more effectively.
- The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave - what they do.
- Test-driven development, continuous integration and comprehensive configuration management enable more frequent, higher-quality and lower-risk software releases (i.e. continuous delivery).
